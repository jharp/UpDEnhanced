# UpDEnhanced
An **extension** for use with Fantasy Grounds Unity.  

UpDEnhanced is an **extension** that allows players to better control their updates.  Full control is given to the user to select exactly which components they will update.

_Currently only Windows platform has been tested._  Please do not use this on any other platform.

**Quick Overview**
1.  Download the BasicBepInEx_107.zip file.
2.  Unzip the file.
3.  Determine where your Fantasy Grounds application is installed.
4.  Open the FGUpdaterEngine folder inside the Fantasy Grounds application folder.
5.  Copy contents of the unzipped file to the FGUpdaterEngine folder.  Make certain this is the contents of the zip and **not** the base unzip folder.  The contents include a single folder named BepInEx and 3 other files.
6.  Go up one folder and launch FantasyGroundsUpdater.exe
7.  Determine that the install worked by observing the "Update" button is now "Update...".  **If you do not see "Update..." then the install is incorrect.**

Please understand that **Extensions == RISK**.  We want users to understand that extensions are code that is added or overrides portions of code in the FGU application.  When the underlying code in FGU changes it can break an extension.  We will continue to update this extension as FGU changes.
