# UpDEnhanced
A paid **extension** for use with Fantasy Grounds Unity.  

UpDEnhanced is an **extension** that allows players to better control their updates.  Full control is given to the user to select exactly which components they will update.

_Currently only Windows platform has been tested._  Please do not use this on any other platform.

**Quick Overview -- WINDOWS ONLY**
1.  Ensure that you have a working FG install and have done at least a basic update some time in the past.
2.  On this site, click the BasicBepInEx_107.zip listing.  This will go to the page for this file.
3.  On the right hand side, there is a icon that has a down arrow into a work basket.  This is the download raw file option for this file.  Click it.
4.  Determine where your Fantasy Grounds application is installed.
5.  Open the FGUpdaterEngine folder inside the Fantasy Grounds application folder. **Destination folder**
6.  Find the downloaded file.
7.  Unzip the downloaded file.
8.  Go into the unzipped folder, and traverse down the folders until you find a folder named BepInEx.  You should also find 3 other files at the same level.
9.  Copy the one folder BepInEx and the 3 other files to the **Destination** folder above.
10.  Go up one folder from the **Destination** folder and launch FantasyGroundsUpdater.exe
11.  Determine that the install worked by observing the "Update" button is now "Update...".  **If you do not see "Update..." then the install is incorrect.**
12.  Once you confirm the install is correct, obtain a license at https://forge.fantasygrounds.com/shop/items/944/view

**Quick Overview -- OSX/Linux**
1.  Contact me on discord and if enough people desire this then I will find a way to test it.



Please understand that **Extensions == RISK**.  We want users to understand that extensions are code that is added or overrides portions of code in the FGU application.  When the underlying code in FGU changes it can break an extension.  We will continue to update this extension as FGU changes.
